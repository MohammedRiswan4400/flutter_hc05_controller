# Flutter IoT Bluetooth Controller (HC-05)

A professional IoT mobile application built with Flutter to communicate with HC-05 Bluetooth modules via Serial Port Profile (SPP). This app allows users to scan devices, establish connections, control hardware (LEDs), and exchange raw string/HEX data using a custom terminal.

## 🚀 Features
* **Real-time Scanning:** Detects available Bluetooth Classic devices instantly.
* **Bi-Directional Communication:** Send strings/commands and receive responses from Arduino.
* **Terminal Interface:** A chat-like interface to view logs (Tx/Rx) for debugging.
* **Hardware Control:** Dedicated buttons to toggle GPIO pins (LED ON/OFF).
* **Auto-Connect:** Remembers and reconnects to the last paired device.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
* **Hardware:** Arduino UNO, HC-05 Bluetooth Module
* **Communication:** RFCOMM / Serial Port Profile
* **State Management:** GetX / Provider (Use whichever you used)
